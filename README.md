## Project Overview
This project involves:

- **Data Architecture**: Designing a modern data warehouse using medallion architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
- **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
